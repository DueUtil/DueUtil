##:icon-slime: Getting started## As soon as the bot sees you it will create you an account. 
You\'ll start of as a <span style="font-size:14px" class="level">Level 1</span> with ¤100!

To start off you might want to have a look at your profile. You can do this with ``!myinfo``.
The bot will respond with something a little like:
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/a307f008c0df67604bf9d07f4c11f6c2.svg" alt=":pen_fountain:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue\'s** information.

  </div><div class="extra-info">This is your baisc stock profile. 
  Next to your avatar is your banner that has your battle name, level and current exp shown on it. 
  On the left you can see the last eight awards you got (starting with the most recent).
  In the information section you can see your stats, cash, equipped weapon and wager/quest stats.
  Your profile can be customized with themes, banners and backgrounds.</div>
</div>
If you want to improve your stats a little (helps with quests early on). 
You can do ``!train`` every six hours.
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message">**MacDue** training complete!

##:icon-dagger: Weapons## When questing gets harder you'll need a weapon.
