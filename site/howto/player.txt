##:icon-slime: Getting started## As soon as the bot sees you it will create you an account. 
You\'ll start of as a <span style="font-size:14px" class="level">Level 1</span> with ¤100!

To start off you might want to have a look at your profile. You can do this with ``!myinfo``.
The bot will respond with something a little like:
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/a307f008c0df67604bf9d07f4c11f6c2.svg" alt=":pen_fountain:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue\'s** information.
    <img src="../img/myinfo.png"></img>
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This is your baisc stock profile. 
  Next to your avatar is your banner that has your battle name, level and current exp shown on it. 
  On the left you can see the last eight awards you got (starting with the most recent).
  In the information section you can see your stats, cash, equipped weapon and wager/quest stats.
  Your profile can be customized with themes, banners and backgrounds.</div></div>
</div>
If you want to improve your stats a little (helps with quests early on). 
You can do ``!train`` every six hours.
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message">**MacDue** training complete!
  <img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/54e1b293350b4fdc172e2b5fb7e28bd8.svg" alt=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" draggable="false">+0.15<img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/0e2bb36113661c72bb9b3b4e5c834f97.svg" alt=":muscle:" class="emoji" draggable="false">+0.19<img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/43df7da20ea936e1016d1ea5d79a2c6c.svg" alt=":dart:" class="emoji" draggable="false">+0.14
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">The stats gained from this are random!
  (in the range of 0.1 to 0.2)</div></div>
</div>
Want a little pocket money? Try ``!daily``!
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/ccebe0b729ff7530c5e37dbbd9f9938c.svg" alt=":moneybag:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **dsfhnjf** collected their daily ¤50!</div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">You can do this once every 24 hours</div></div>
</div>
 ##:icon-quest: Questing## Quests are the main way to gain exp and stats.
 Every 6 minutes you get a chance of a quest spawn (you are **not** guaranteed a quest every time).
 
 When you do you a quest the bot will send you a "new quest" alert like the one below!
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/54e1b293350b4fdc172e2b5fb7e28bd8.svg" alt=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue** New Quest!
<img src="../img/new_quest.png"></img>
</div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">The level of quests you get will be near (but not exactly) your level.
"Kill the" is the spawn message you can set when you create a quest.</div></div>
</div>
If you want to accept this quest first check ``!myquests``
You'll see a list like this:
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/54e1b293350b4fdc172e2b5fb7e28bd8.svg" alt=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue\'s** Quests!
    <img src="../img/myquests.png"></img>
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This is what your quest list will look like with a few active quests.
The little blue box in the top left corner of a quest is that quest's number (used for ``!questinfo`` and ``!acceptquest``)
The little icons in the bottom right corner are meant to give you an idea of how hard the quest is (red being hard and green easy)</div></div>
</div>
So if you've checked your ``!myquests`` you should now know the number of the quest want to accept.
BUT first you probably should (unless the quest appears super easy) check the quests stats.
You can do this with ``!questinfo \<quest number\>``
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/a307f008c0df67604bf9d07f4c11f6c2.svg" alt=":pen_fountain:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> Here you go.
    <img src="../img/questinfo.png"></img>
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">``!questinfo`` is similar to ``!myinfo`` just without the awards and for quests.</div></div>
</div>
Okay! So you're ready to take on the quest now!
Do ``!acceptquest \<quest number\>``
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img/quest1.png"></img>
<TPL:embeds/questlose.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">Oh no! You lost!
  It must be **RIGGED** /s
  But really losing quests is quest common especially early on.
  You may find it hard to get started but remember you'll always have ``!train`` and ``!daily``.</div></div>
</div>
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img/quest2.png"></img>
<TPL:embeds/questwin.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">Yay! We have a winner!
  When you beat a quest you'll get a cash reward and stats!
  The amount of cash you get depends on how hard the quest is and what weapons were used.
  Same for stat gain.</div></div>
</div>
<h5>Common problems!</h5> <h6>The bot won't let be do the quest but I'm strong!</h6><div class="flex-content-row">
<div style="height: 22px" class="discord-message"><img src="https://discordapp.com/assets/94a29a1805306022db268195f85831fb.svg" alt=":bangbang:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **You can't afford the risk!**
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This **does not** mean you're weak!
  It means you don't have the money to start the quest.
  You need half the reward of a quest to start it as it you lose the quest you'll lose that cash.
  You cannot go into debt.</div></div>
</div><h6>I only get +0.01 stats WTF!</h6> Ha! You can't use OP weapons agaist poor little quests with weak or crappy weapons and expect a big reward.
Give your quests weapons don't use your __**ULTRA MEGA CANNON**__ agaist your poor little slime quest.
##:icon-dagger: Weapons## When questing gets harder you'll need a weapon.
