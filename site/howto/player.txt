##:icon-slime: Getting started## As soon as the bot sees you, it will create you an account. 
You\'ll start of as a <span style="font-size:14px" class="level">Level 1</span> with ¤100!

To start off, you might want to have a look at your profile. You can do this with ``!myinfo``.
The bot will respond with something a little like:
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/a307f008c0df67604bf9d07f4c11f6c2.png" alt=":pen_fountain:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue\'s** information.
    <img src="../img/myinfo.png">
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This is your basic stock profile. 
  Next to your avatar is your banner that has your battle name, level and current exp shown on it. 
  On the left you can see the last eight awards you got (starting with the most recent).
  In the information section you can see your stats, cash, equipped weapon and wager/quest stats.
  Your profile can be customized with themes, banners and backgrounds.</div></div>
</div>
If you want to improve your stats a little (helps with quests early on), you can ``!train`` every six hours.
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message">**MacDue** training complete!
  <img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/54e1b293350b4fdc172e2b5fb7e28bd8.png" alt=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" draggable="false">+0.15<img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/0e2bb36113661c72bb9b3b4e5c834f97.png" alt=":muscle:" class="emoji" draggable="false">+0.19<img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/43df7da20ea936e1016d1ea5d79a2c6c.png" alt=":dart:" class="emoji" draggable="false">+0.14
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">The stats gained from this are random!
  (in the range of 0.1 to 0.2)</div></div>
</div>
Want a little pocket money? Try ``!daily``!
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/ccebe0b729ff7530c5e37dbbd9f9938c.png" alt=":moneybag:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue** collected their daily ¤50!</div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">You can do this once every 24 hours</div></div>
</div>
 ##:icon-quest: Questing## Quests are the main way to gain exp and stats.
 Every 6 minutes you get a chance of a quest spawn (you are **not** guaranteed a quest every time).
 
 When you do you a quest the bot will send you a "new quest" alert like the one below!
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/54e1b293350b4fdc172e2b5fb7e28bd8.png" alt=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue** New Quest!
<img src="../img/new_quest.png">
</div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">The level of quests you get will be near (but not exactly) your level.
"Kill the" is the spawn message you can set when you create a quest.</div></div>
</div>
If you want to accept this quest first check ``!myquests``.
You'll see a list like this:
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/54e1b293350b4fdc172e2b5fb7e28bd8.png" alt=":crossed_swords:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **MacDue\'s** Quests!
    <img src="../img/myquests.png">
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This is what your quest list will look like with a few active quests.
The little blue box in the top left corner of a quest is that quest's number (used for ``!questinfo`` and ``!acceptquest``).
The little icons in the bottom right corner are meant to give you an idea of how hard the quest is (red being hard and green easy).</div></div>
</div>
So if you've checked your ``!myquests`` you should now know the number of the quest you want to accept.
BUT first you probably should (unless the quest appears super easy) check the quests stats.
You can do this with ``!questinfo \<quest number\>``
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/a307f008c0df67604bf9d07f4c11f6c2.png" alt=":pen_fountain:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> Here you go.
    <img src="../img/questinfo.png">
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">``!questinfo`` is similar to ``!myinfo`` just without the awards and for quests.</div></div>
</div>
Okay! So you're ready to take on the quest now!
Do ``!acceptquest \<quest number\>``
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img/quest1.png">
<TPL:embeds/questlose.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">Oh no! You lost!
  It must be **RIGGED** /s
  But really losing quests is quest common, especially early on.
  You may find it hard to get started, but remember you'll always have ``!train`` and ``!daily``.</div></div>
</div>
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img/quest2.png">
<TPL:embeds/questwin.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">Yay! We have a winner!
  When you beat a quest you'll get a cash reward and stats!
  The amount of cash you get depends on how hard the quest is and what weapons were used.
  Same for stat gain.</div></div>
</div>
<h5>Common problems!</h5> <h6>The bot won't let me do the quest but I'm strong!</h6><div class="flex-content-row">
<div style="height: 22px" class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/94a29a1805306022db268195f85831fb.png" alt=":bangbang:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **You can't afford the risk!**
  </div><div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This **does not** mean you're weak!
  It means you don't have the money to start the quest.
  You need half the reward of a quest to start it, as it you lose the quest you'll lose that cash.
  You cannot go into debt.</div></div>
</div><h6>I only get +0.01 stats WTF!</h6> Ha! You can't use OP weapons agaist poor little quests with weak or crappy weapons and expect a big reward.
Give your quests weapons and don't use your __**ULTRA MEGA CANNON**__ agaist your poor little slime quest.

##:icon-dagger: Weapons## When you have a little cash you'll probably want to get yourself a weapon.
On DueUtil, weapons are created by the admins on whatever server you're on and appear in that server's shop!

If you want to have a look at what's on offer on the server you're on do ``!shop weaps`` (there are more than just weapons sold in the shop).
You'll see something like this:
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><TPL:embeds/shop.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">This is the first page of the shop on the support server.
  Join if you want one of these weapons!</div></div>
</div>
To have a closer look at a weapon in the shop do ``!shop \<weapon name\>`` it will bring up the weapons stats card.
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><TPL:embeds/shopgun.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">You can also see this card after you buy the weapon by doing ``!myweapons \<weapon name\>``.
  The price shown then will be how much the weapon will sell for - not how much it cost you!</div></div>
</div>
So you've found a nice weapon?
Do ``!buy \<weapon name\>``!
<div class="flex-content-row">
  <div style="height: 22px" class="discord-message">**MacDue** bought a **Musket with Bayonet** for ¤361</div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">If you already have a weapon equipped, you'll have to equip your new weapon!</div></div>
</div>
To see your weapons and switch out which one you're using do ``!myweapons``.
<div class="flex-content-row">
<div class="discord-message"><TPL:embeds/myweapons.tpl></div>
  <div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">You can store up to 6 weapons and have one equipped!</div></div>
</div>
You can unequip your current weapon with ``!unequip`` but unless you want to fight bare-handed there is no need to unequip.
Swapping weapons is done with the ``!equip \<weapon name\>`` command. 

##:icon-fist: Customization## As well as weapons you can get themes, banners, and backgrounds for your profile in the shop.
Only I (MacDue) can add these items though you're welcome to suggest ideas.

You can view the list of whats on offer as well as view a preview the same as with weapons.
Checking the list of themes (for example), is the same as with weapons but you swap "weaps" for "themes" (``!shop themes``).
Just doing ``!shop`` will tell you this.

<div class="discord-message"><img src="../img//discordassets/emojis/593c4a3437fbb5b89fbb148f7b96424d.png" alt=":wave:" class="emoji" draggable="false"> **Welcome to the DueUtil general store!**
Please have a look in some of our splendiferous departments!

<div class="extra-info"><div class="maccy-tip">We have the best departments. 
**The best.**
Nobody has a better departments than we do!</div></div>

Here's an example of how you could get your profile looking.
