##:icon-fist: Setting up channels:## After adding the bot you may want to limit it's use to certain channels or not allow it to send unprompted alerts in some channels.
    This can be done with the ``!shutupdue`` command, ``!shutupdue`` will stop the bot from sending alerts (new quest, level up, etc)
    and ``!shutupdue all`` will completely disable the bot in a channel.
        
    If you just want to limit what commands can be used in channels that can be done with the ``!whitelist`` and ``!blacklist`` commands,
    both commands just take a list of commands (seperated with spaces).
    These commands only effect non-admins and are not independant (blacklist just sets and inverted whitelist).
##:icon-dagger: Creating weapons:## You can create weapons for your server's weapon shop (``!shop weaps``).
        
    The command to do this is a litte long.
      
    If you just want to make a really basic weapon with just a name, an attack message and damage and accuracy,
    you can do something like this:
      
    ``!createweapon "Laser" "FIRES THEIR LAZOR AT" 100 50``
        
    This would create a weapon called "Laser" with the attack message "FIRES THEIR LAZOR AT" and it would have 100 damage and 50% accuracy.
        
    Here's how that would look in the shop.
    <TPL:embeds/basiclaser.tpl>
    If you want to make a weapon that's a little more interesting you can add a few extra parameters.
        
    ``!createweapon "Laser" "FIRES THEIR LAZOR AT" 100 50 True :gun: http://i.imgur.com/wAET49W.png``
    
    This one would appear like so - note the custom image.
    <TPL:embeds/laser.tpl>
    This will create a "Laser" weapon like before but it will also be marked as ranged (the "True" in the command),
    will have and icon the ``:gun:`` emoji and a image that shows up on the ``!shop \<item name\>`` page (that shows the weapons information)
    and on the battle screen.
    
    **Some things to note:** <ul style="font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px; margin-bottom: -30px;">
      <li>You cannot set the price of weapons. 
      This is because the bot and any weapons you create can be used on any server.</li>
      <li>The max accuracy is 86% - no weapon can have more than this.</li>
      <li>The min damage is 1.</li>
    </ul>
##:icon-slime: Creating quests:## Like with weapons you can create basic and more intersting quests.
    
    To make a simple quest you could do something like:
        
    ``!createquest "Mega Mouse" 1.3 2 1.1 32``
        
    This will create a very simple quest called "Mega Mouse".
        
    The will have the base values:
      1.3 Attack
      2 Strength
      1.1 Accuracy
      32 HP
          
    [Quest spawn image]
          
    If you want to spice up this quest a little you could do:
        
    ``!createquest "Mega Mouse" 1.3 2 1.1 32 "Oh crap it's a" "Dagger" http://i.imgur.com/ZKGSWRZ.png 21``
        
    This would create the "Mega Mouse" like before but would have the spawn message "Oh crap it's a", 
    the quest will be equipped with a dagger, will have a custom image for the quest and will have a spawn rate of 21%.
        
    [Quest spawn image]
        
    Setting quest channels:
Giving others "admin" pemissions for the bot.
