# This project is outdated! There's a new DueUtil at https://dueutil.tech/

# DueUtil
### The questing and fun discord bot!

#### Running the bot
(more detailed setup / install script later -- maybe)

Requirements:
* Python 3.5 +
* The packages in requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* MongoDB  (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
* PHP & Apache (if you really want to run the site too)

##### Setup the DB
1. Create an account that can create & update databases (admin will do)
2. Put the account details in `dbconfig.json`

```json
{
    "host":"localhost",
    "user": "dueutil",
    "pwd": "hunter1"
}
```
(the host will probably be localhost)

##### Configure DueUtil
Create a file `dueutil.json` in the same folder as `run.py` (the root).
```json
{
   "botToken":"[DISCORD BOT TOKEN]",
   "owner":"[OWNER DISCORD ID]",
   "shardCount":1,
   "shardNames":[
      "Clone DueUtil: shard 1"
   ],
   "logChannel": "[SERVER ID]/[CHANNEL ID]",
   "errorChannel": "[SERVER ID]/[CHANNEL ID]",
   "feedbackChannel": "[SERVER ID]/[CHANNEL ID]",
   "bugChannel": "[SERVER ID]/[CHANNEL ID]",
   "announcementsChannel":"[SERVER ID]/[CHANNEL ID]",
   "carbonKey":"[https://www.carbonitex.net key you won't have]",
   "discordBotsOrgKey":"https://discordbots.org/ key you also won't have",
   "discordBotsKey": "https://bots.discord.pw/ key you also also won't have",
   "discoinKey":"http://discoin.sidetrip.xyz/ you will never get",
   "sentryAuth": "[SENTRY AUTH]"
}
```
The logging channels are currenly needed (the bot may not work properly without them), the bot probably can run without the other keys.

##### Restoring the database

1. Download the database dump from the last release
2. Extract that zip into folder called `database`
    ```
    database
    `-- dueutil
        |-- award_stats.bson
        |-- award_stats.metadata.json
        |-- _CacheStats.bson
        ...
    ```
    Your file tree should look like this
 3. Use mongorestore
    ``mongorestore  --username your_use --password "your_pass" --authenticationDatabase admin ./database``

##### Run DueUtil!

DueUtil can be ran with: `python3 run.py`

### Can't run the bot?!
I expect it will be fiddly to get this bot running, but please don't ask me to set it up for you I'm not going to help.
