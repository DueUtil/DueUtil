## DueUtil a shitty discord bot made for shits & giggles

#### Featuring:
 
* Crappy package names 
* Bugs
* Poorly documented code
* More bugs
* TODOs
* Not reading any PEP guides
* Unhelpful module names
* Rants in comments
* And MUCH more terrible design decisions!

Note: This bot does not use the discord py command extension (and a few other features)
as I find it more fun making my own versions of things projects like this and 
helps me learn a little more. I know the pre existing solutions are probably
better than mine - but that's no fun.
